# Evolutionary Insights into Technology: A Novel Distance-Based Phylogenetic Approach  
## Abstract
Technological evolution, much like biological evolution, is marked by continuous innovation and adaptation, reshaping society and influencing economic systems. This study introduces a novel distance-based method for constructing technological phylogenies, addressing the limitations of traditional phylogenetic models. Unlike gene-based approaches, this model measures technological distances to better capture complex dynamics such as horizontal knowledge transfer and path dependency. Validated with empirical data from mobile products and AI research, this approach demonstrates flexibility and precision in mapping evolutionary paths. By providing mathematical formulas for phylogeny construction, this method offers a robust framework to analyze technological trends and identify pivotal innovations, advancing our understanding of technological evolution.
